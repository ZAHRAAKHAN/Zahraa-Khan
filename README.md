<h3 id="custom-id">HOW IS CREATIVE COMPUTING AFFECTING HUMAN SENSES?</H3>

<h5>human network senses station</h5> 
--------------------------------------
<p>Now that technology is outrageously accelerating conducting impact and effects on the human perception network.
 
 
<h6>Social media doesn’t simply imply good BUT bad tackles a case of emotional synthesia.<h6>
 
 <p>In the current situation, where people are very much influenced from social media, especially when there’s constant pressure for 'new' music and 'new' technology, we repeatedly have to adapt to updating to new communication technology therefore leading to the question of, "who rules over music?".
  Music has installed into a man made robot(sounds definitely intimidating) yet has played a key role in shaping the music/technology industry. Moreover, technology has changed how people produce music. That’s to say that overtime people to the point have felt anxious or restrained when they hear a certain timbre.
  
Such a compatible and tenacious relationship arises into 'music dependence,'
which raises the dispute; "is music cultivating synesthesia or dissection?"

| Types      | Definition |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| (Neurological condition) AKA Synesthesia  | when you hear music but you see\hear shapes, colours, words or a name. 
| Emotional  | emotional sensation in which a conflict between the photism and presented a colour of stimulus make evoke a feeling of discomfort depending on the colour type. 
| Chromosthesia | specifically when a person hears sound they visualise the colours through playing an intrument.
| Phonemes | triggers synesthetic tastes.. after you listen to the piano e.g
| Metaphor | seeing the similar in the dissimilar-e.g most commonly seen by artists, novelists, musicians and painters in their work.

 <h3>So what's my proposal!<h/3>
  
 <h5>Program-Adobe After Effects</h5>
 
 <h6>Conducting an experiment using a recording of a piano tune and uploading it so that i can experiment with coloured lighting and add in some geometric shapes. The aim is to create a electric keyboard that signals a persons mood through different colours and shapes whilst listening or playing something random, will detect a persons feelings. There are many different ways we can use creative computing to inable us to recognise and detect synesthesia through playing an intrument, stimulating our brains to think more openly. Through digitally designing 2D motion graphics, line/geometric animation and waveform animation which can visually represent music synesthesia.<h/6>

<h6>It all starts with our DNA and our cranial nerves in the human body. Cranial nerves are the pathways through which environmental infor/(sensation) is directly communicated to the brain, leading to perception. In simple form its the occurrence when one sensory experience automatically triggers another sense.

  <h3>IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW ONLY 4% OF THE WORLDS POPULATION HAS 'SYNESTHESIA'SOME FORM<H/3>
   
   <h6>'music dependence'-is very common in synesthesia according to Carol Steen, the co-founder of the American Synesthesia Association. Says that many peoplle whose jobs related to music and technology converts any sort of information to a visual representation- this is an example of intentional synesthesia. It's also agreed by philosopher, that those who have Synesthesia are the ones who have better memory. The opposite of this is 'An-es-the-sia'having no feeling.

<h3>Reflection<h/3>
    
<h6>I initially thought creative computing was all about coding and i don't favour working with coding that much, as i thought it would be very boring. Nevertheless, with an open-mind i was able to find myself actually enjoying it. I've learnt a ton of new things about creative computing and was really enjoyable making the proposal, as i got to do a lot of it independently. As this was my first time doing programming, it went really well with the research i've found to secure my idea. Through this week's study, i was able to complete a circuit after many failures of where to put each wire and kept having errors however it was a success in the end. As it could be something useful in the world of pyschology and tech and music. Also, i beleieve now that things are having rapid development its sort of easier to connect science to music with technology. Plus it's rare to see art combining with computer/technology. And now that the world is becoming more and more computer based its without doubt that this will be popular. Eventhough this was a week's project i would still like to comeback and produce the machine that allows pyschologists under the human brain and its senses through music and technology as it'll be a fun and advanced way of understanding Synesthesia. By doing so i'll improve my programming skills and Ardunio/Adobe skills.<h/6>
