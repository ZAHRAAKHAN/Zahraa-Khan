<h3 id="custom-id">HOW IS CREATIVE COMPUTING AFFECTING HUMAN SENSES?</H3>

<h5>human network senses station</h5> 

<p>Now that technology is outrageously accelerating conducting impact and effects on the human perception network.
 
 
<h6>Social media doesnâ€™t simply imply good BUT bad tackles a case of emotional synthesia.<h6>
 
 <p>In the current situation, where people are very much influenced from social media, especially when thereâ€™s constant pressure for 'new' music, we repeatedly have to adapt to updating to new communication technology therefore leading to the question of, "who rules over music?".
  Music has installed into a man made robot(sounds definitely intimidating) yet has played a key role in shaping the music/technology industry. Moreover, technology has changed how people produce music. Thatâ€™s to say that overtime people to the point have felt anxious or restrained when they hear a certain timbre.
  
Such a compatible and tenacious relationship arises into 'music dependence,'
which raises the dispute; "is music cultivating synthesia or dissection?"
